# react-native-supermarket-tracker

## Prerequisites:

1. NodeJS
1. expo-cli
1. Android Studio and/or XCode

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

---

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache flag` to the start script:

### `npm start --reset-cache`

or

### `yarn start --reset-cache`

---

### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

Warning: Running eject is a permanent action (aside from whatever version control system you use). An ejected app will require you to have an Xcode and/or Android Studio environment set up.
