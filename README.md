# react-native-supermarket-tracker

## Prerequisites:

1. NodeJS
1. expo-cli
1. Android Studio and/or XCode

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the Expo app on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache flag` to the start script:

### `npm start --reset-cache`

or

### `yarn start --reset-cache`
